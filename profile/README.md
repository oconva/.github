# Oconva

Oconva - Open Conversational AI - is on a mission to make conversational AI more open and accessible to all.

We envision a future where any developer, regardless of their available resources, can empower their apps with the power of conversational AI. Whether it's adding an AI assistant to their app or integrating a translation service, Oconva aims to provide developers with open-source tools and frameworks to support them on this journey.

## Goals

- **Develop and maintain open-source conversational AI tools**: Your support will enable us to create and improve the tools and frameworks that developers worldwide can use to integrate AI into their applications.
- **Foster a community of innovation**: Sponsorships will allow us to organize workshops, webinars, and community events to share knowledge, encourage collaboration, and drive innovation in the field of conversational AI.
- **Ensure accessibility and inclusivity**: We strive to make our tools and resources available to developers from all backgrounds, promoting diversity and inclusion within the tech community.
- **Enhance app accessibility for users worldwide**: By providing developers with advanced conversational AI tools and frameworks, we aim to make applications more powerful, accessible and user-friendly for people from various backgrounds and languages.

## Projects

- [**Intento**](https://intento.pkural.ca) - Open-source intent recognition framework to allow developers and organizations to create and self-host reliable and performant intent-recognition services powered by Large Language Models (LLMs).
